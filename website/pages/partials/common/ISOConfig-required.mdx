-   `iso_checksum` (string) - The checksum for the ISO file or virtual hard drive file. The type of
    the checksum is specified within the checksum as a prefix, ex:
    "md5:{$checksum}". The type of the checksum can also be omitted and
    Packer will try to infer it based on string length. Valid values are
    "none", "{$checksum}", "{$path}" "md5:{$checksum}", "sha1:{$checksum}",
    "sha256:{$checksum}", "sha512:{$checksum}" or "file:{$path}".
    Although the checksum will not be verified when it is set to "none",
    this is not recommended since these files can be very large and
    corruption does happen from time to time.
    
-   `iso_url` (string) - A URL to the ISO containing the installation image or virtual hard drive
    (VHD or VHDX) file to clone.
